## ⚠️ Antivirus Warning

Since this program simulates mouse clicks and controls your keyboard (automation), some antivirus software might flag it as a "False Positive".
*   This is normal for macro software compiled with PyInstaller.
*   If blocked, simply add an exclusion or disable AV temporarily.
*   The source code is open above for you to inspect!
